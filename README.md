###  What I‚Äôm Working On

- Developing **TorchPINN**, a production-ready PyTorch library for solving partial differential equations using Physics Informed Neural Networks  built from the ground up with modular design and research-grade scalability.
- Building a **multi-modal model** to classify hate speech in video content using text, audio, and visual signals.
- Creating a minimal and useful **college application assistant** that helps students shortlist universities, track deadlines, and organize application documents, all in one place.
- Exploring LLMs, cloud deployment, and advanced deep learning training pipelines.
- Always tinkering with side projects in finance, machine learning, and full-stack development.
